# hello-api-nodejs

This is my Homework Assignment #1 for the course The Node.js Master Class by Pirple.

```
Please create a simple "Hello World" API. Meaning:

1. It should be a RESTful JSON API that listens on a port of your choice. 

2. When someone posts anything to the route /hello, you should return a welcome message, in JSON format. This message can be anything you want. 
```

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Running the tests

Clone the project and run it using node

```
> cd <Project Folder>
> node index.js
```

use Postman to test the API

```
http://localhost:3080/hello
```
